This site was created on March 14th, 2020. Much of the world's population is currently under some sort of quarantine amidst the outbreak of [Covid-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019).

*Quarantzine* seeks to document this moment -- a collection of responses to the current moment, as well as a collection of resources to help us through.
