This site was created on March 14th, 2020. Much of the world's population is currently under some sort of quarantine amidst the outbreak of [Covid-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019).

*Quarantzine* seeks to document this moment -- a collection of responses to history as it happens, as well as a collection of resources to help us through.

The basic idea is that folks like you can submit audio, visual, video, and written work that will be compiled into an online [zine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine). Depending on the number of things submitted there may be more than one issue of the zine. 

[Submit stuff to the zine](https://bb.quarantzine.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=4).

Folks like you can also connect and share resources on our [forum](https://bb.quarantzine.com/) (still a work in progress, but coming very soon!). 

> "...wait!?"

Yeah, a **forum**. We are going web 1.0!!!
